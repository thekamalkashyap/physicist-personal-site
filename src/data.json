    "text1":"Math and physics are two sides of same coin, the coin of nature (nature here refers to whole universe). Physics is the study of phenomenon that occurs in nature whereas mathematics is study of patterns found in nature.",
    "text2":"Despite being closely connected, research in physics and math relies on different methods. In physics as systematic study of matter, its behavior, making of theories and supporting or refusing of these theories and laws done on the basis of observations and experiments. In math is focused on topics such as quantity, structure and space. Mathematicians look for patterns and develop new ideas and theories using pure logic and mathematical reasoning. Instead of experiments or observations.",
    "text3":"This does not suggest that both math and physics are completely independent of each other. Physicists rely highly on math for computations in their work and do- not work on understanding of abstract or essence of mathematical ideas. Similarly mathematicians use physics as a tool of inspiration, with concepts such as general and special theory of relativity and m-theory providing a momentum for mathematicians to develop new ideas.",
    "text4":"When you go too back in history you really can’t tell who is a physicist and who is mathematician. This was the time mathematics and physics were not treated as separate disciplines. “Newton was the first physicist” says Sylvester James Gates, a physicist at Brown university. His focus in gravity and laws of motion lead to discovery of a new field in mathematics that is calculus."
